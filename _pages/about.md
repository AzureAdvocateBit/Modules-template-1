# Working with the material
The simplest way to enjoy these materials is to view each lesson online here. In such a case, you could follow along and write your own version of the programs to run with your local R installation.

You can also **download/fork** the whole collections of Notebooks from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/trallard/BAD_days). That way you can use your local copy of the materials and follow along the course and make your own modifications/extensions.

## About the course

The core of this tutorial is built around the [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org), an interactive computational environment run in a web browser.

In this particular case we will be using the R programming language for the data exploration/analysis.
