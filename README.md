# Modules template

Modules template is a Jekyll template tailored specifically for use by academics and researchers wanting to generate a _literate programming friendly_ and _hassle free_ static website.
This can be used as a scientific blog template or as a webpage to host/display projects information, scientific outputs or as a site for academic modules.

It's features include the ability to create blog posts, the ability to create and host [Reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/) presentations. It also enables tight integration with Jupyter notebooks and Microsoft Azure notebooks.

It is also designed to be hosted on GitHub pages. Modules template allows you to create a well designed, functional and completely free website. Hosting on GitHub pages allows you to keep the website in one place, even if you move between institutions.

The live demo of this template can be found at [http://bitsandchips.me/Modules-template/](http://bitsandchips.me/Modules-template/) ðŸ’»


## Why Should I Use This?

By using this template you will have a website that is well designed, easy to maintain, free to host and easy to update. While there are many options out there for personal and professional websites, most are dependant on the platform on which they were built, and cannot be easily migrated. This template, while built for GitHub Pages integration, provides flexibility should you choose to host it elsewhere.
